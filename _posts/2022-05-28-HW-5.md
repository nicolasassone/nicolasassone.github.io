title: Building a Simple Messaging Bank with Flask
---

In this post, we will demonstrate how to locally build a simple website with flask that is designed to be a message bank: that is, allow a user to submit a message attached to their name, and then look at a few random messages from the database.

Note that all the code can be found at my github repository at https://github.com/nicolasassone/HW2_git_repo/tree/main/IMDB_scraper



We begin by creating a folder within github desktop that will host our project.
Within this host folder, we then create two more files: an app.py and then a templates folder.

We first discuss the templates. Within the templates folder, create three .html files titled `base`, `submit`, and `view`, with the base template controlling the overall look of the website. The code for the base is as follows and controls the font, coloring, and titles.

Next is the submit template which is a page that inherits its structure from the base template, and serves as the main page that our website navigates to. It has a header titled "submit", and has two input blocks for the user to fill with any message and their name (which is stores under the variable names message and handle). It also accepts the boolean parameters ```thanks``` and ```error```, which will be specified by the submit function in `app.py` and determine whether or not the page displays a thank you message if the file was submitted successfully or an error message if it was not.

Next we go into our `app.py` file which will build the website. The necessary imports are as follows: 
```python
from flask import Flask, g, render_template, request
import numpy as np
import sqlite3



app = Flask(__name__)

```

The following code routes into the user into the main site, which is the submit page that was written above

```python
@app.route('/')

def main():
    return render_template('submit.html')
```

We next write our `get_message_db()` function which either accesses the messages database if it already exists, or creates the database that shall contain the user-inputed messages and corresponding handles. 

```python
def get_message_db():
    try:
        return g.message_db #acceses messages database if it exists

    except: #otherwise creates messages data base organized by 
            #handle (aka the name of the user) and the 
            #corresponding message
        g.message_db = sqlite3.connect("messages_db.sqlite")
        cmd = \
        '''
        CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `messages` (
            id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
            handle TEXT NOT NULL,
            message TEXT NOT NULL
        );
        '''

        
        cursor = g.message_db.cursor()
        cursor.execute(cmd)
        return g.message_db
```

Next is `insert_message()`, which connects to the messages database and then inputs the handle and message entered by the user (which come from the request variable)

```python
def insert_message(request):

    #calls previous function to access message database
    conn = get_message_db()

    #command to insert the user-inputed handle and message into the database
    cmd = \
    f'''
    INSERT INTO messages (handle, message)
        VALUES ('{request.form["handle"]}', '{request.form["message"]}'); 
    '''


    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute(cmd)
    conn.commit()
    conn.close()
```

Next is `random_messages(n)`, which randomly grabs at most n-messages from the messages database and returns the result. This function will come in handy later for viewing the messages. 

Finally, we use the above three functions in the creation of our webpages. The first is the submit page, which accepts either `POST` or `GET` depending on if the user is accessing the page or submitting their information. If `GET`, then submit just renders the submit template. If `POST`, then it inserts the user inputted handle and message into the messages database through `insert_message(request)` and then renders the submit template with `thanks` equalling `True` (which by the code earlier will allow for a nice thank you message). If this process fails, then it renders the submit template and displays an error message.

```python
#submit page
@app.route('/submit/', methods=['POST', 'GET'])
def submit():
    if request.method == 'GET':
        return render_template('submit.html')
    else:
        try: #tries to use insert function on user input and store in
             #database and thanks user
            insert_message(request)

            return render_template('submit.html',thanks=True)

        except: #if doesn't work, render submit website with error
            return render_template('submit.html',error=True)


```

The view page function simply calls the view template with the `random_messages(8)` function from earlier to view the website with at most 8 randomly picked messages

```python
@app.route('/view/')
def view():

    #returns at most 8 random messages from the database
    return render_template('view.html', messages=random_messages(8))
```

We provide a few screenshots.

THe first demonstrates the page and typing a sample message in

Note that the colors and font comes from the base template that was mentioned. 

The following is what appears after submitting said info (which the server recieved successfully) and the picture after allows one to view the messages sent in
