title: Scraping IMDB For Movie Recommendations
---

In this blog post, I will be creating a web scraper which scrapes a movie/show's IMDB website, and generates a table of 
movie recommendations using this information. As an example, we will be looking at Game of Thrones (as it is the greatest show), but any IMDB movie/show link will work.

This task is divided into two parts. First, we create a spreadsheet where the first column is the cast and the second column is all the movies that the actor starred in. Next, we use this spreadsheet to create a table containing two columns, where the first column is the previously obtained movies and the second is the number of shared Game of Throne's actors in each movie.

The following is a link to the Github repository containing the exact code used here: https://github.com/nicolasassone/HW2_git_repo/tree/main/IMDB_scraper

# Creating the Scraper

We begin by creating a scrapy project, titled ```IMDB_scraper```. This is done by opening command line, then ```cd```ing into the directory that scrapy was installed in and running the following line.
```python
scrapy startproject IMDB_scraper
```

Next, we create an ```imdb_spider.py``` file in the spiders directory of the above folder. Within this file, we import scrapy and create our class with the following IMDB URL to Game of Thrones.

```python
import scrapy

class ImdbSpider(scrapy.Spider):
    name = 'imdb_spider'
    
    #the url we start on. In my example, we use the link to game of thrones
    start_urls = ['https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0944947/']
```

We divy up the spider's task by writing three different parse methods, where one calls another in a sequential manner. In the first parse method, its purpose is to navigate to the Game of Thrones 'Full Credits' website and then call the ```parse_full_credits``` method.

```python
#First parse method
    def parse(self, response):
        sitelink=response.urljoin("fullcredits")
        yield scrapy.Request(sitelink, callback=self.parse_full_credits)
```

We next write our ```parse_full_credits``` method. It essentially works by getting the link that one occurs when 
clicking on each actor's image, storing them in a list, and calling the next parse method ```parse_actor_page``` for every actor in the cast.

```python
def parse_full_credits(self, response):
        #scrapes the path to each picture of the actors of the cast on the fullcredits page
        actor_paths=[a.attrib['href'] for a in response.css('td.primary_photo a')]

        #creates a list of links to each actor in the cast using the list of paths above
        actor_links = ['https://www.imdb.com' + path for path in actor_paths]

        #for every url to each actor in the above list, it calls the next parse method
        for url in actor_links:
            yield scrapy.Request(url, callback = self.parse_actor_page)
```

We finally write the ```parse_actor_page``` method. This works by first navigating to the header section and pulling out the name of the actor. 
It next runs a for loop to grab the names of all the movies this actor was in, and then writes this into a "results.csv" spreadsheet which 
has two columns, one for the actor's name and the other for all of the movies the actor took part in

```python
def parse_actor_page(self, response):

        #for loop which iterates once to navigate to the header section
        #containing the name of the actor, and then uses string operations
        #to pull out the actor's precise full name
        for header in response.css('h1.header'):
            name = header.css("span.itemprop").get()
            name=((name.split('>'))[1].split('<'))[0]

        #for loop which runs through all the different movies
        #of this fixed actor, and then uses string operations 
        #to pull out the exact name of the movie the actor was in
        for movie in response.css("div.filmo-row"):
            title=movie.css("a::text")
            title = str(title[0])
            title = (title.split("'"))[3]

            #creates a .csv spreadsheet with two columns containing an actor
            #and the movie they were in. This is nexted in the above for loop, 
            #and so it runs through every movie the actor was in
            yield {"actor" : name, "movie_or_TV_name" : title}
```

After creating this spider, we navigate to the directory of the project in the terminal and run the following command

```python
scrapy crawl imdb_spider -o results.csv
```

This outputs our desired spreadsheet as described above within the same file directory as the IMDB project. Here is a screenshot representing the first few rows (there are 34,000 in total) of the output spreadsheet

# Movie and Show Recommendations

The rest of this blog post will discuss the creation of a table of TV show/movie recommendations based off of the previously obtained data.

We begin with the following standard imports:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
```
We next read in the scraped csv file as a pandas data frame and display the first five rows.

```python
df = pd.read_csv (r'D:\ucla_class_work\Spring-2022\pic16b\HW2_git_repo\IMDB_scraper\results.csv')
df.head()
```
![head_spreadsheet.png](/images/head_spreadsheet.png)

The next body code involves using this dataframe to create a dictionary where the keys are the movie names and the values are the number of actors from game of thrones that the movie shares. 

```python
result_mat = df.to_numpy() #Changes the data frame into a numpy array

movie_dict={} #initalize dictionary

#for loop that ranges through the number of movies in the 
#matrix, and stores the name as the keys in a dictionary with
#the corresponding value representing the number of times they
#appear in the matrix
for i in range(result_mat.shape[0]):
    
    if result_mat[i][1] in movie_dict: #increases the value by one
                                       #if the movie is already in 
                                       #the dictionary
        movie_dict[result_mat[i][1]]+=1
    else:
        movie_dict[result_mat[i][1]]=1 #appends it with value 1
```

From here, one only needs to sort the above dictionary with a general sorting technique and then create a data frame for a nice display.

```python
#sorts the dictionary into a list, where each element is a pair 
#with the movie/show name and its corresponding count 
#(aka the number of shared actors). The list is sorted by
#its count in ascending order
sorted_movie_list=sorted(movie_dict.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)

movie_recs = pd.DataFrame(sorted_movie_list, columns = ['Movie/TV Show', 'Number of Shared Actors'])
movie_recs
```
![movie_recs.png](/images/movie_recs.png)

We also create a bar graph using `matplotlib` that displays the top movie 6 recommendations of the above data set.

Note: we exclude Game of Thrones from the graph given that it was the TV show we started on.

```python
#chops off row 0 which is Game of Thrones and displays the next 6
top_movie_recs=(movie_recs.drop(0)).head(6)

#plots these movies/shows on an appropriately sized bar graph
fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.add_axes([0,0,2,1])
ax.bar(top_movie_recs['Movie/TV Show'],top_movie_recs['Number of Shared Actors'])
plt.show()
```
